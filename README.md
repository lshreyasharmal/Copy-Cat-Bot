Advisor: [Tanmoy Chakraborty](http://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~tanmoy/)

Natural   language   processing   and   deeplearning  techniques have  been applied  tovarious real world problems liking build-ing  chat  engines.   Software  chat  enginesare  everywhere  from  E-commerce  web-sites  to  social  media.   The  idea  of  usingchatbots to mimic certain personalities hasalso been used in the past by researchers.The main motivation is to be able to recre-ate the inspiration which is obtained fromeminent  personalities.   In  this  work,  webuild a chatbot engine to mimic Dr.  APJAbdul Kalam .  We use a sequence to se-quence model to be able to generate our re-sponses to queries put forward by the user.We have manually scraped query-responsepairs  from  online  sources  such  as  inter-views with Dr.  Kalam.  The responses ofour trained chatbot are close to the speak-ing style of Dr.  Kalam.
