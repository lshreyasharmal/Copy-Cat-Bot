# Kalam Chat bot

This is the course project for Natural Language Processing class

Advisor: [Prof. Tanmoy Chakraborty](http://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~tanmoy/)

Natural language processing and deep learning techniques have been applied to various real-world problems liking building chat engines. Software chat engines are everywhere, from  E-commerce websites to social media. The idea of using chatbots to mimic certain personalities has also been tried in the past by researchers. The main motivation is to be able to recreate the inspiration which is obtained from eminent personalities. In this work, we build a chatbot engine to mimic Dr.  APJ Abdul Kalam. We use a sequence-to-sequence model to generate our responses to queries put forward by the user. We have manually scraped query-response pairs from online sources such as interviews with Dr. Kalam. The responses of our trained chatbot are close to the speaking style of Dr. Kalam.
